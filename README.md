#Comments from Philipp's script:

# input parameters shoudld be:
# - data file with T,field amplitude,  and Q0 as columns
# - which columns the T, Eacc, Q0 data is in
# - geometric factor G
# - RF frequency (watch unit, MHz in this code)
# - beta factors for field distribution correction (array of four floating point numbers)
# - measured field amplitude
# - SWR for uncertainty
# - output file(s) that contain:
    # - fit results and uncertainties
    # - fit quality parameter (R^2..)
